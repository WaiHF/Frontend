                For my placement and gap year I provided IT support to 4 offices and 170+ care homes across
                the UK. From June 2019, I played a crucial part in the Regard and CMG merger by assisting in
                the migration of IT infrastructure and procedures. Accomplishments:

            <ul>
                <li>Deployed fibre to 80+ care homes and resolved all network faults that occurred during the
                    upgrades within the project timeline.</li>
                <li>Implemented a “potentially compromised account” procedure using Azure reports to
                    proactively find and remediate at risk accounts.</li>
                <li>Liaised with stakeholders and successfully migrated network folder data using Powershell.</li>
                <li>Trained 80+ users to work remotely through remote desktop and VPN during merger.</li>
                <li>Migrated all asset data to Zendesk and conducted an asset audit which greatly improved
                    the registry's accuracy.</li>

            <h3>Kingston University</h3>

            <p>
                <b>Topics covered:</b> Programming (focused on OOP), Networks & Security, Project Management,
                Relational Database Modelling, and Data Analysis.

                <br><br>

                <b>Final year project:</b> Web based relational database visualisation and validation tool. The tool
                allowed students to interactively build ER diagrams and be provided real time feedback on any potential
                mistakes in normalisation. The tool was built with only HTML, CSS, and Javascript which made it
                easily hostable and accessible on the web
