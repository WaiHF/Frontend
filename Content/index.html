            <h3>Desktop Support Analyst - University for the Creative Arts</h3>
            <p>Sept 2020 - Nov 2022</p>
            <p>
                I worked within an ITIL framework and provided 1/2nd line support for UCA and international partners
                where I maintained SLAs and exceeded KPIs in a busy environment. I continuously cooperated with
                and learned from experts which allowed me to reduce my escalations and take on more
                responsibilities. Notable responsibilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed annual studio mass reimaging utilising SCCM (Windows) and Jamf (MacOS /
                    IOS) for remote management.</li>
                <li>Utilised Sophos and Tenable Nessus to monitor for and remediate compliance issues and
                    security threats on all devices.</li>
                <li>Provided application support for a diverse range of commercial software used across UCA.</li>
                <li>Produced documentation and provided IT training for both technical and end users.</li>
                <li>Processed accounts and equipment for starters, leavers, and movers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IT Helpdesk Analyst - The Regard Group & Care Management Group (CMG)</h3>
            <p>Aug 2017 - Sept 2019</p>
            <p>
                During my degree placement and additional gap year, I provided IT support for 4 offices and 170+
                care homes across the UK. Working independently and being proactive were crucial due to the small
                size of the department. From June 2019, I contracted with CMG to complete their merger with
                Regard. Accomplishments:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deployed fibre to 80+ care homes and resolved all network faults that occurred during the
                    upgrades within the project timeline.</li>
                <li>Implemented a “potentially compromised account” procedure using Azure AD reports to
                    proactively find and remediate at risk accounts.</li>
                <li>Established IT requirements for new care home acquisitions and delivered on the
                    requirements.</li>
                <li>Liaised with stakeholders to successfully migrate file server data using Powershell.</li>
                <li>Trained 80+ users to work remotely through remote desktop and VPN during merger.</li>
                <li>Migrated asset registry to Zendesk and conducted an asset audit to improve accuracy.</li>
                <li>Migrated all Windows 7 devices to Windows 10 within project deadlines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>Kingston University</h3>
            <p>BSc (Hons) Computer Science - 1st</p>
            <p>
                <b>Topics covered:</b> Programming (focused on OOP), Networks & Security, Project Management,
                Relational Database Modelling, and Data Analysis.

                <br><br>

                <b>Final year project:</b> Designed and delivered a single page diagramming web application
                for a client at the university. The application allowed students to quickly build ERDs through the
                browser and have basic error checking run on the diagram which greatly reduced mistakes.
