                <b>Final year project:</b> Web based relational database visualisation and validation tool. The tool
                allowed students to interactively build ER diagrams and be provided real time feedback on any potential
                mistakes in normalisation. The tool was built with only HTML, CSS, and Javascript which made it
                easily hostable and accessible on the web
